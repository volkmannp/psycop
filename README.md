# PsyCoP
 
The platform for systematic cognitive and behavioral profiling, short PsyCoP, was published with a pilot study here:
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2020.618180/full

It consists of series of behavioral experiments and an analysis pipeline. The latter can be found on this repository.
Most of the code comes in the form of a FlowR bundle, which can be opened and read in FlowR.
For instructions how to install FlowR and the resources needed to get it running visit: http://www.xbehavior.com/flowr-for-you/

Additionally, there is a number of complementary scripts available, which comprise the more sophisticated parts of the downstream analysis, as they are the subject to regular change. However, some elements of the script have already been implemented in FlowR as part of the bundle and some more functions will follow.
